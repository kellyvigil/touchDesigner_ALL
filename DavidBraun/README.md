# TouchDesigner_Shared
This repository contains Touch Designer files that I've created. Please note the GNU General Public License v3.0. I'll accept pull requests and bug reports. I'll even accept feature requests--just be nice about it.

You can find demos of a few of these files on my [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/davidbraun) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkDwJxKzQocvGhQOCTQi70w) pages.
